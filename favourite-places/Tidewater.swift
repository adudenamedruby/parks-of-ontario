                     about: "\u{2022} Tidewater Provincial Park, a partnered park operated under agreement with the Moose Cree First Nation, is located in the northernmost part of Ontario near the salt waters of James Bay and Hudson Bay.\n\u{2022} This special park attracts visitors and campers looking for an unusual and exciting outdoor experience.\n\u{2022} The park consists of five islands in the Moose River estuary close to Moose Factory and Moosonee. From Moosonee, there are water taxis to take visitors to the park islands. Caution is advised as the winds, tides and river currents can challenge the most experienced canoeists.\n\u{2022} If you’re lucky, you may glimpse a seal or the milky white back of a beluga whale from the campgrounds.\n\u{2022} This park is also a destination for those who are canoeing the Missinaibi River or Abitibi River. To reach this park, visitors either fly to Moosonee or travel from Cochrane on the famous Polar Bear Express train service that runs daily in the summer months.",
