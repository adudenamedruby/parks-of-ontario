The only way to explore the interior of this park is by canoe or on foot.\n\u{2022} There is also a second Algonquin - along the 56 kilometre stretch of Highway 60. Here you can enjoy camping at one of eight campgrounds, hike one of 14 trails, take part in extensive Natural Heritage Education programs, and visit Algonquin’s exceptional Visitor Centre, Logging Museum and Art Centre.\n\u{2022} For over 50 years, each Thursday in August, park staff have offered the “Public Wolf Howl”, a highly engaging program on wolf ecology that includes howling for wolves. Weather and wildlife dependent.\n\u{2022} Excellent trout fishing, particularly in the month of May.\n\u{2022}Amazing moose viewing opportunities along Highway 60 as the moose are attracted to roadside salt left after the winter sanding operations.\n\u{2022} Spring also features outstanding birding opportunities throughout the park with spring arrivals and migrants."
