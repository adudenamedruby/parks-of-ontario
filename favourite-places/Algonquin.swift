A valid permit is required to use the park. Permits can be purchased at the East or West Gates or at the self-service station at the Mew Lake Campground.

Wide touring skis and large basket poles are essential for soft snow conditions. \n\n\tLeaf Lake Trail system provides some of the most beautiful vistas and exhilarating skiing available anywhere. These trails are found one km west of the East Gate. As you explore the landscape you may see the tracks of moose, otter, ruffed grouse, marten and many other animals. \n\n\tLeaf Lake Ski Trail offers a wide variety of trail selections ranging in length from 5 to 51 km and ranging from easy to very difficult.
