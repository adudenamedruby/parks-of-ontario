It is here that you can see nesting Bald Eagles, a Great Blue Heron rookery and the origins of the 2007 forest fire. From there a series of portages and small lakes takes you deep into the heart of the park. The landforms and vegetation in the Two Narrows Lake area is the central natural heritage feature of the park. Ground moraines created by glaciers thousands of years ago lie on top of rolling bedrock cloaked in forests dominated by jack pine, white birch and poplar. The canoeist can then travel back from Trapper Lake along the original route or through Benny Lake. This canoe route can be competed in one day but there are interior campsites for those who wish to spend more time enjoying the solitude. Dawn and dusk offer excellent wildlife viewing opportunities. \n\n\u{2022} Antrim Lake Canoe Route \n\tLocated at the northern edge of the park, Antrim Lake is accessed on the east side of highway 144. This day trip offers spectacular scenery including tall cliffs and ample wildlife viewing opportunities.

The trail then wanders north along the west shore of Echo Pond where grassy wetlands provide an ideal place for sighting wildlife. Beaver, mink and the majestic moose are regular visitors to this area. Echo Pond Trail connects to the much longer Hawk Ridge Trail. Be sure to watch the trail signsso that you are not hiking onto the longer trail! \n\n\u{2022} Hawk Ridge Trail - Rating: Difficult - Length: 15 km, 6-8 hours \n\tThis is the longest and most difficult hiking trail in the park.  Hawk Ridge extends off the northern portion of Echo Pond Trail and travels deep into the heart of the interior. The trail passes through part of the forest devastated by the 2002 tornado when mature trees were instantaneously flattened. The trail visits several lakes including tiny Lost Lake with several low cliffs that provide great vantage points. One of the highlights of the trail is the lookout over Three Island Lake. It alone is worth the trip. There are a few interior campsites located along the last stretch of the trail that the weary hiker can rest for the night. * Interior camping fees apply. \n\n\u{2022} Osprey Heights Trail - Rating: Moderate to Difficult - Length: 6 km, 2 hours \n\tLocated on the east side of Highway 144, towards the north end of the park, this trail starts across a short section of low wetland forest before climbing sharply up into the rugged rocky hills of the Canadian Shield. The trail meanders east through mossy clearings, forests and along cliff tops to the edge of Antrim Lake. The Osprey Heights Lookout provides a superb view from over 50 metres above Antrim Lake. This is a great photo opportunity and an ideal place to stop for lunch. The trail then loops back west."), 5: (heading: "\(aHnt)", detail: "Hunting is permitted only in the park addition.
