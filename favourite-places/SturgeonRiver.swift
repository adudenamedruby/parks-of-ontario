                         about: "\u{2022} The Sturgeon River provides canoeists with plenty of whitewater, scenic falls and rapids, wildlife spotting and good fishing, all in a remote setting.\n\u{2022} Enjoy the river’s continually changing scenery, from long slender lakes to narrow river channels, rapids and shallows. The river begins in the Temagami highlands, with bedrock outcrops eventually turning to sandy shores over the course of a week-long paddle\n\u{2022} This scenic river was once used by loggers to float timber downstream to distant mills, and some evidence of the days of the “river drives” can still be found along the river’s shores.",
