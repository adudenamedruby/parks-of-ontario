These drumlins were formed thousands of years ago by glaciers, and largely left as woodlots by European settlers. The spring wildflowers can be spectacular in spring. \n\nThe Blue and White Trails take you near areas where the Ferris family’s sugar houses, shingle mill, granary and sheep pens once stood. The Red Trail goes around the back of the second drumlin, taking you past the old W. Cock Brickyard. Little physical evidence remains of these pioneering enterprises but their legacy as the forerunners of today’s vibrant local communities is not forgotten. \n\n\u{2022} Ranney Falls Trail - 1 km (0.5 hours), loop, easy, level \n\tThis trail follows the original roadway to Ferris Provincial Park before looping back along the river, where there are magnificent views of the Ranney Gorge Suspension Bridge and Ranney Falls. The gorge edge habitat supports different vegetation from the rest of the park, including the regionally rare Chinquapin Oak. Look for its unique saw-tooth shape on trees along the trail or on fallen leaves underfoot.  The trail finishes by passing through a restful picnic area, perfect for lunch, or a short break. \n\n\u{2022} River Gorge Trail - 3.5 km (2 hours), loop, easy, parts can be wet in the spring. (Yellow markers) \n\tThis trail offers magnificent views of the Trent River gorge from the Ranney Gorge Suspension Bridge, before continuing downstream past the old Ferris Quarry and onto the legendary “sheep wash”, now a picnic area. The trail continues south, following the river’s edge for more fantastic views of the Trent River. On your way back upstream the trail travels through meadows and past Ferris’s unique stone fences, some of which have recently been rebuilt."), 6: (heading: "\(aNHE)", detail: "The Friends of Ferris offer a number of interpretive and recreational activities during the park’s operating season.
