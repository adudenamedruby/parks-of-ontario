                   about: "\u{2022} The Spanish River and Biscotasi Lake are favourites for backcountry canoeing. Its rugged landscape, towering pines, variety of whitewater, a chance to include road or train access options and choice of routes make it a popular trip.\n\u{2022} The Spanish River offers paddling for canoeists of intermediate skill level, with Class I and II rapids, lots of swifts and moving water. Take the East Branch of the river for whitewater fun or take the train to Biscotasing to start your trip on the wilder, West Branch of the river.\n\u{2022} Stay on huge island-studded Biscotasi Lake for flatwater paddling and great fishing.\n\u{2022} No reservations necessary.\n\u{2022} Historic route of the Ojibwe, 18th century fur traders and turn of the century Forest Ranger Archie Belaney, known later as Grey Owl.",
