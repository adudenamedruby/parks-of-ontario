                  camping: [0: (heading: "\(cCar)", detail: "Awenda offers camping in six campgrounds. Sites are shaded beneath Sugar Maples and Red Oaks and are spaced further apart than many other provincial parks. All of the sites in Wolf and some sites in Hawk Campground offer electrical hook-ups. Deer and Bear Campgrounds are designated radio-free while Snake Campground is both radio-free and dog-free.\n\nAll six campgrounds are serviced by drinking water taps, vault toilets and a central comfort station complete with flush toilets and showers. Laundry facilities are included at the comfort stations in Turtle, Hawk and Bear Campgrounds."), 1: (heading: "\(cDog)", detail: "All campsites in Snake Campground are dog-free and radio-free."), 2: (heading: "\(cGrp)", detail: "Awenda offers three group campsites.  These sites are designated for tents only and are for groups ranging in size from a minimum of 20 to a maximum of 40 people.

                  activities: [0: (heading: "\(aBik)", detail: "Several kilometers of park roads are available for cyclists.\n\nBikes are also allowed on the Beach, Bluff and Brule Trails. Since these are multi-use trails, racing is not permitted and cyclists must yield to pedestrians and hikers.\n\nCyclists are encouraged to respect and protect the often sensitive environments that these trails pass through by riding only on the designated trail surface."), 1: (heading: "\(aBrd)", detail: "Awenda is home to at least 120 breeding bird species. The park’s upland forests provide a critical habitat refuge for the endangered Cerulean Warbler.\n\nThe park’s trails, lakes, shorelines, fens, bogs and campgrounds offer a mix of habitat for a variety of viewing opportunities and discovery."), 2: (heading: "\(aBtg)", detail: "Boating enthusiasts will find plenty of room to investigate Georgian Bay. Because of its size and exposed area, Georgian Bay winds can be unpredictable and quick to rise, so use appropriate caution.\n\nThe closest boat launch facilities are in Penetanguishene. Outboard motors are not allowed on Kettle’s Lake."), 3: (heading: "\(aCan)", detail: "Awenda’s quiet and scenic Kettle’s Lake is an excellent location for putting in your own canoe or one you rent from the park. This small, motorboat free lake is ideally suited for the novice paddler or nature enthusiast."), 4: (heading: "\(aFsh)", detail: "Bass, Northern Pike, pickerel and smaller panfish are commonly found in the waters between Awenda and Giant’s Tomb Island. Bass and panfish are also found in Kettle’s Lake."), 5: (heading: "\(aHik)", detail: "Awenda offers a nice variety of looped and linear, easy to moderate trails and range from 1 to 13 km in length. One trail provides barrier-free access. \n\n\u{2022} Beach Trail – 4 km return (1.5 hours) linear, easy \n\t This trail takes hikers along the Georgian Bay shoreline. Giant’s Tomb Island is visible from the trail. The contrast between the dry oak-maple forest of the campgrounds and the low, wet birch-cedar-hemlock forest below the bluff can be seen. \n\n\u{2022} Beaver Pond Trail – 1 km (30 minutes) loop, easy, barrier free  \n\tLocated in a nature reserve zone most of this trail is a boardwalk that takes you through an area altered by past and present beaver activity. Along the way you will see the remains of both a building and a bridge from the early logging days. The area also offers views of the dominant Nipissing bluff as well as excellent opportunities for viewing wildlife, wildflowers and many species of birds. \n\n\u{2022} Bluff Trail – 13 km (3.5 hours) loop, moderate \n\t This circular trail can be accessed from a number of locations within the park. It travels partly along a high bluff and partly through a low wetland. Views of Georgian Bay from sections of this trail are spectacular, especially during the late autumn, early spring leaf- free season. \n\n\u{2022} Nipissing Trail – 1 km return (30 minutes) linear, moderate  \n\tThe Nipissing Bluff is the dominant glacial feature in Awenda. It is a raised beach created 5,500 years ago by glacial Lake Nipissing. Today a 155 step staircase allows hikers to easily descend 32 metres down the face of the bluff, at times providing you with the sensation of being part of the forest canopy. \n\n\u{2022} Brûlé Trail - 4 km return (1.5 hours) linear, easy\n\t This trail passes through a portion of the park’s upland mixed deciduous forest. Lumbering and fires have obliterated the White Pine stands so that the majority of trees are now Sugar Maple and Red Oak. Lumbering on the peninsula was at its peak in the late 1800s. Since then the forest has been allowed to revert to its natural state but the White Pine has been unable to fully re-establish itself. \n\n\u{2022} Robitaille Homestead Trail – 3 km return (1hour) linear, easy \n\t Hikers follow this trail to an ancient dune system. The age of these sand dunes has been estimated at 11,500 years, from the time of the last glacial retreat. The dunes are a very fragile environment and we ask that you do not climb the hillside, stand on the edge of the bluff or climb down the bluff. This will allow plants to re-establish themselves and will help us preserve this area for future park visitors. On the way to the dunes, this trail passes an abandoned farmstead originally built in 1902. Remains of the stone foundations and fence rows can still be seen. \n\n\u{2022} Wendat Trail – 5 km (2 hours) loop, easy \n\tThis trail begins at Kettle’s Lake. This lake is thought to be a kettle lake formed by the gradual melting of a large buried piece of ice left by retreating glaciers. Today, this area is a favoured nesting spot for the Red-winged Blackbird and the Great Blue Heron is often seen in the swamps around the lake. The trail passes the foundations of the Brabant farmstead house and barn. Attempts to farm this area in the 1930s and 40s failed due to the poor, sandy soil."), 6: (heading: "\(aNHE)", detail: "Awenda offers a wide variety of programs for enthusiasts of all ages. Regularly scheduled guided hikes, children’s programs, special events and evening programs occur from late June to early fall featuring the unique cultural history and the biology of the park."), 7: (heading: "\(aSwm)", detail: "Awenda features several beautiful and natural beaches on the Georgian Bay shoreline within driving distance from the campgrounds. The most protected and sandiest beach area is at Methodist Point Bay (Third Beach). Swimmers are reminded that that there are no lifeguards at the beaches. \n\nFor a refundable deposit, you can borrow a properly fitted personal floatation device (PFD) during your stay at Awenda. \n\nAwenda has designated a stretch of its scenic Georgian Bay shoreline as a Pet Beach. This is the only public beach in the park where pets are permitted. However they still must be kept on a two metre leash and it is the owner’s responsibility to clean up after them."), 8: (heading: "\(aWA)", detail: "The park is not open for camping, but the trails and forests are available as a backcountry style experience for the more adventuresome ski and snowshoe enthusiast. \n\nTrails begin at the Trail Centre, a cozy wood heated log cabin. Although 17 kilometres of ski trail are often packed and set with a single track, be prepared to occasionally track your own trails due to the backcountry intent of this self-use winter program. \n\nSnowshoeing is popular through the park’s many hectares of open bush; however there are no designated snowshoe trails. \n\nDogs are not permitted on winter trails and visitors must provide their own equipment as rentals are not available. \n\nFor the most current trail conditions at Awenda and other Ontario Parks check the ski trail report.")],
                  facilities: [0: (heading: "\(fBF)", detail: "Awenda’s six comfort stations are barrier-free as is the park amphitheatre. \n\nEach campground has a designated barrier-free campsite (sites #24, #96, #141, #193, #215, and #295), with a modified picnic table, easy access to drinking water and the comfort station. \n\nThe vault toilets/outhouses in Wolf and Snake Campgrounds are barrier-free as are some vault toilets in Bear and Deer Campgrounds. \n\nThe First Beach area is serviced by three barrier-free vault toilets, viewing platform and the one kilometre Beaver Pond Trail and boardwalk. The Kettle’s Landing day-use area has a barrier-free vault toilet, boardwalk, picnic and viewing area.

Staff can provide additional information and can outfit you with a PFD at the Campground Office. \n\nElectrical extension cords for trailer units are also available for a daily or weekly fee. \n\nCanoes, complete with paddles and PFDs, are available to rent, by the hour or the half day, for use on Kettle’s Lake by campers. Canoe rentals are not available for day use visitors. Rentals are available for the months of July and August only.")])
