There are several campsites on Banks, including one where the Makobe River starts, next to the first falls. Alexander Lake has a number of campsites for the second night, although camping next to a rapid is often a great way to get to sleep. The last day ends at the Town of Elk Lake. \n\nPlease Note: Permits are required for all overnight backcountry camping.

Makobe-Grays protects a similar although narrower forest, where many of the same species of birds can be seen. During the nesting season of spring and early summer, many species of warbler, thrush, flycatcher and woodpecker can be heard calling to defend territory. Eagles, osprey and many other birds of prey can be spotted hunting above the forests of the park. Keep an eye open for birds around the campsite in the morning and at the end of the day."), 1: (heading: "\(aBtg)", detail: "Motorboats are permitted on Alexander Lake only."), 2: (heading: "\(aCan)", detail: "Canoeists travelling the Makobe River come for challenging whitewater. The river itself is a short trip, two or three days of paddling if flying into Makobe Lake by floatplane, and taking-out at the Town of Elk Lake. \n\nThe rapids and drops along the river are technical and require scouting. Water conditions early in the season depend on the snowmelt and early trippers may encounter snowfall and even ice-bound lakes, after very cold winters. Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater and the Makobe River are higher in elevation than the surrounding areas, like Elk Lake and Temagami. A number of cliff-side locations retain ice and snow into late May. \n\nThe Makobe route can also be combined with other routes, primarily those of Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater where the Makobe River begins. The Grays River to the south connects to the Lady Evelyn River, and the Makobe flows into the Montreal River. These can be linked to Lady Evelyn Lake, forming a circle route but only when there are high water conditions."), 3: (heading: "\(aFsh)", detail: "Brook trout are the most abundant species on this river."), 4: (heading: "\(aHnt)", detail: "Hunting restrictions apply.
