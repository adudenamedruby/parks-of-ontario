However, limited fishing opportunities are available in the park’s eastern and northern sections."), 5: (heading: "\(aHik)", detail: "All Killarney’s hiking trails cover uneven and rocky terrain. Sturdy footwear, plenty of water and a park map and compass is recommended. Killarney Provincial Park offers five day-use hiking trails plus may other hiking opportunities. \n\n\u{2022} Chikanishing Trail 3 km (1.5 hours) moderate  \n\tThis trail winds along the park’s southern boundary and crosses a series of small ridges and then ending at a wave-washed point on Georgian Bay. Vegetation is typical of the rocky, windswept terrain of Georgian Bay, though taller pine and oak have flourished in wind-sheltered spots where soil has accumulated. Old iron rings used for mooring lines during logging days can still be seen along the trail. Interpretive plaques tell the colourful history of this part of Georgian Bay. \n\n\u{2022} Cranberry Bog Trail 4 km (2.5 hours) moderate  \n\tHikers along the trail pass some of the park’s loveliest scenery. Bogs, marshes and swamps are home to Sundew, Leatherleaf, Pitcher Plant and Cranberry. Beaver feed piles can be seen along the way. Many birds frequent this trail’s habitats and Blanding’s Turtles make an occasional appearance in Cranberry Bog. Look for evidence of glaciation—smooth rock surfaces, striations and chatter marks. \n\n\u{2022} Granite Ridge Trail 2 km (1 hour) moderate \n\t Providing views of the unique La Cloche Mountains for which Killarney is renowned the trail winds through old fields and forests and climbs to a ridge with two lookouts over the park. To the south, your eye moves along the shore from Collin’s Inlet and Philip Edward Island to the expanse of Georgian Bay. To the north, see the spectacular La Cloche Mountains. \n\n\u{2022} Lake of The Woods Trail 3.5 km (3 hour) moderate to difficult \n\tThis loop trail encircles Lake of the Woods, traveling through a variety of forest types, from old growth stands to elevated rocky outcrops. These outcrops offer excellent views of Silver Peak, six kilometres to the west and Lake of the Woods below. At one point, the trail descends to the lakeshore where a short boardwalk connects to the lake’s only island. \n\n\u{2022} The Crack 6 km (4 hour), difficult  \n\tThe view from the top of Killarney Ridge is absolutely stunning. The immense white cliffs of the La Cloche Mountains surround you as you ascend through the cascade of huge tumbled boulders of what is known as 'The Crack'. Once you reach the top of the ridge, you’ll be treated to beautiful panoramic vistas on all sides – certainly one of the best views in the park! \n\nNote: Do not try to reach the Crack unless you are in good shape and can get an early start. \n\n\u{2022} La Cloche Silhouette Trail 80 km loop (7-10 days) strenuous  \n\tAlthough this trail takes up to 10 days to do in its entirety, hikers can take shorter trips starting from two trailheads in George Lake Campground. (Day hikers should leave sufficient time to retrace their steps along the trail back to the campground.) \n\nThe west section of this trail is moderate, heading to Acid and Lumsden lakes over rolling forested hills. It crosses small streams and rivers, occasionally following the rocky shores of small lakes. Keep on the lookout for wildlife or clues of their presence. \n\nThe east section of this trail heads uphill to the Crack, a ridge with a vista of rugged and scenic landscapes. Considered strenuous, this section passes through forests and wetlands and over rocky ridges. It takes 12 hours of steady hiking and you have to climb over large boulders to reach the top of the ridge. Do not try to reach the Crack unless you are in good shape and can get an early start."), 6: (heading: "\(aHnt)", detail: "Hunting is prohibited in the vast majority of Killarney Provincial Park.

Snow-covered evergreen forests line the trail providing beauty and a peaceful escape from the winds. Collins Inlet Trail \n\n\u{2022} (Classic: 14.3km) - This loop trail is packed, but not always track set. As you pass through mature pine forests, open fields and frozen-over marshlands, don’t forget to take a break and enjoy the serenity of this remarkable landscape. \n\n\u{2022} Freeland (Classic: 12.4km) - This linear track-set trail winds east through open hardwood and coniferous forest, past Cranberry Bog and onto scenic Freeland Lake. \n\nCall ahead for snow and ice conditions or check the Ontario Parks ski report. \n\nKillarney also offers walk-in winter camping and six heated yurts.
