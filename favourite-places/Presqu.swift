Land-based fishing can be enjoyed at the Calf Pasture Picnic Ground or just outside the park from the Municipality of Brighton’s “Government Dock”."), 5: (heading: "\(aHik)", detail: "Presqu’ile was made for walking; its flat terrain and views of Lake Ontario attract walkers all year. A favourite route for many is the paved one-way driving loop (Lighthouse Lane and Paxton Drive) around the peninsula. This road has a designated walking/bike lane and is plowed in the winter. This is still a road however and walkers are urged to be cautious, particularly in the busy summer months. For those wanting a more natural experience Presqu’ile has 12 km of traditional “off-road” trails. All trails are clearly marked with coloured plastic blazes and are cleared of deadfall on a regular basis. \n\n\u{2022} Jobes’ Woods Trail – 1.0 km, 30 minutes, loop, easy \n\tThis trail winds through an area that was once part of a farm settled by Thomas and Ezekial Jobes in 1835. This part of their farm remained relatively undisturbed by settlement activity and today contains one of the oldest deciduous woodlots at Presqu’ile. \n\nThe trail passes by towering old maples, vernal pools crossed by boardwalks, conifer plantations, and an old field which is filling in with ash trees after a century of use by the Jobes family. An interpretive guide introducing visitors to the ecology of the Jobes’ forest is available at the trailhead or can be downloaded in the maps tab. \n\n\u{2022} Owen Point Trail – 1.6 km, 45 minutes, loop, easy \n\tThis trail offers excellent opportunities to see migrating shorebirds along the natural beach and distant views of the waterbird colonies on their island nesting grounds. The trail can be accessed from the south end of the beach or from the west end of High Bluff Campground. \n\nTo avoid disturbing migrating birds, the natural beach is closed to foot traffic between ice-out and ice-in, but the trail provides a number of lookouts allowing views of the entire shore. In addition, pets are not allowed into any of the lookouts on this trail at any time, but can be taken on the loop. To protect the nesting waterbirds, access to Gull and High Bluff Islands is closed from March 10 to September 10 inclusive. Gull Island can usually be accessed by foot after September 10 from Lookout #5 of the Owen Point Trail. \n\nAn interpretive guide to the ecology of the point and the islands is available at the trailhead or can be downloaded in the maps tab. \n\n\u{2022} Marsh Trail – 1.2 km, 30 minutes, loop, easy \n\tThis trail includes 800 m of boardwalk complete with two viewing towers and a teaching platform (great for picnics too!) that takes visitors into the marsh. Sixteen interpretive panels along the trail illustrate the story of the marsh and its inhabitants.  The boardwalk portion of the trail is barrier-free. \n\n\u{2022} Pioneer and Newcastle Trails – 8.1 km, 3 hours, two interconnected loops, easy \n\tThese trails lead you through the forests, plantations and old fields found in the heart of the Presqu’ile peninsula.  Along these trails you will encounter a diversity of plants and wildlife in the mature beech-maple forest, old fields and early succession forest which dominate this area of the park. \n\nThe Pioneer Trail is 3.8 km and marked by yellow plastic blazes. The Newcastle Trail is 4.3 km and is marked by orange plastic blazes. The trailhead for both trails is halfway along Lighthouse Lane, though there are a number of other access points along both trails.  Both trails use park roadways for part of their length so be cautious of vehicles and monitor children running ahead on the trail. \n\n\u{2022} Lighthouse Foot Path – 300 m, 20 minutes, loop, easy \n\tThis loop connects the Lighthouse Interpretive Centre with the lighthouse itself. There are great views of Lake Ontario and Presqu’ile Bay, with waterfowl in winter and spring, and a cool breeze in summer. Interpretive panels illustrate the history of the area. \n\n\u{2022} Cemetery Trail – 300 m, 15 minutes, linear, easy \n\tThis path connects the cemetery interpretive panel at the Camp Office parking lot with the site of an abandoned pioneer cemetery. The site itself is marked with a commemorative granite boulder, though no other evidence remains."), 6: (heading: "\(aHnt)", detail: "A regulated waterfowl hunt takes place Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays in the marsh and offshore islands from the fourth Friday in September to the third Saturday in December.
