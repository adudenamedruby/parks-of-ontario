                     camping: [0: (heading: "\(cCar)", detail: "Arrowhead offers camping in three campgrounds: Roe, East River and Lumby.\n\nRoe Campground generally offers the most private, well-drained sites. The beach near this campground is less crowded and offers great access for fishing.\n\nEast River Campground is great for RVs, especially along Road 10. It is also closest to Stubbs Falls – a wonderful area to explore. The beach here is also a designated day use beach so tends to be busier.\n\nLumby is divided into two sections: north and south and they are quite similar. Forest cover in Lumby Campground is mixed deciduous forest. It offers great sites for tent trailers and tents. The dog beach is located nearest to the north Lumby Campground."), 1: (heading: "\(cRad)", detail: "Roads 1-4 in East River and South Lumby Campground are radio free from May until September."), 2: (heading: "\(cRof)", detail: "Please see website for up to date details on roofed accomodation.")],

The bluffs are easily visible in the spring and fall but are hidden during the leafy summer months. The trail circles a large beaver pond with large rafts of cattails where you might see otter, moose, Great Blue Heron, Tree Swallows and, of course, beavers. Near the end, the trail crosses a field and you can see evidence of the once successful Oke homestead—old fence lines, building foundations and domestic plants such as rhubarb and apple trees. \n\n\u{2022} Big Bend Lookout – easy \n\tThis short walk from the parking lot on Roe Campground Road leads to a panoramic view of the meandering Big East River and the surrounding Muskoka terrain. \n\n\u{2022} Homesteaders Trail - 3 km (1 hour) moderate \n\tIn the 1870s, homesteaders cleared this area. Take this trail across moderately rugged terrain and see traces of abandoned farm fields now reclaimed by young forest. \n\n\u{2022} Mayflower Lake Trail – 1 km (30 minutes) moderate \n\tTen thousand years ago, Mayflower Lake was a small bay in a large glacial lake. Today it is a small, deep, spring-fed lake. Its cold, clear waters provide ideal habitat for cold water fish such as Rainbow Trout. This trail has several lengthy climbs and descents over the hills surrounding Mayflower Lake and can be muddy, so wear your hiking boots.\n\n\u{2022} Stubb’s Falls Trail - 2 km (45 minutes) easy\n\tTake this trail in early spring when wildflowers and songbirds will be your reward. At Stubb’s Falls, the Little East River rushes down a rock chute.
