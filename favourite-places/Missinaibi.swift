                      camping: [0: (heading: "\(cBac)", detail: "“Big” Missinaibi Lake is a hidden gem, deep in the heart of the largest wildlife preserve in the world. The Barclay Bay Campground docks and boat launch provide access to a lake that is 40 km long, along with Baltic Bay that is 20 km long. All of this water and shoreline means lots of opportunities for exploration. There are 25 interior campsites scattered along the shores of the big lake – each one makes for an ideal backcountry basecamp for boaters and anglers, kayakers and canoeists. Aboriginal rock paintings, historic fur trade posts, abandoned logging camps and old growth Red Pine at its northern limit are some of the places to visit. A backcountry campsite out on the lake is a perfect place for great fishing, wildlife viewing, paddling and just relaxing. \n\nThere are five canoe route options located within the park with over 75 backcountry campsites associated with these routes. These are very remote sites, amenities are rustic (a privy toilet, a fire ring and some tent spotss), therefore, self-reliance and backcountry experience is essential.  The Missinaibi River itself is one of the longest and famous of the canoe routes in the Hudson Bay watershed – 500 km of whitewater river, from the Arctic watershed divide down to James Bay."), 1: (heading: "\(cCar)", detail: "Barclay Bay boasts large, well-treed campsites in a campground with basic amenities such as water taps, vault privies, trailer dump and fill, animal-proof food storage lockers, a fish cleaning house, an extensive dock system capable of handling larger watercraft and a boat launch. There are no electrical hook-ups or comfort stations at Missinaibi Park as this is a true northern park."), 2: (heading: "\(cGrp)", detail: "There is one large, private group campsite located right on the water where you can keep canoes, kayaks and boats moored right at your site. Your group will have your own private washroom complete with a sink with running water. This site must be reserved by calling the Park Superintendent on January 1st at 1-705-864-3114 (leave name telephone number and desired dates) as it is in high demand and books up quickly.")],
                      activities: [0: (heading: "\(aBrd)", detail: "The Missinaibi River flows through the boreal forest, known worldwide as the”Songbird Nursery” of North America. In spring and summer, the boreal forest is such a rich habitat in which to raise young, that forest songbirds like warblers and flycatchers can nest more closely than in other forests and still feed their chicks with enough food. This is the place to see and hear all of these birds in their breeding colours, singing their territorial songs."), 1: (heading: "\(aBtg)", detail: "Motorboats are allowed on Missinaibi Lake and Brunswick Lake. Motorboats are permitted for anglers flying into Little Missinaibi Lake with one of the registered fly-in outfitters for that lake. Motorboats are permitted seasonally on some sections of the river and all season on others. Check with the park for information on restrictions."), 2: (heading: "\(aCan)", detail: "There are five canoe route options within the park, some requiring train travel for access, with over 75 backcountry campsites associated with these routes. These are very remote sites, amenities are rustic (a privy toilet, a fire ring and some tent spots), therefore, self-reliance and backcountry experience is essential.  The Missinaibi River itself is one of the longest and famous of the canoe routes in the Hudson Bay watershed – 500km of whitewater river from the Arctic watershed divide down to James Bay. \n\nTrip options: \n\n\u{2022} Missinaibi Lake to Mattice- advanced, 7 to 12 daq\n\tStart from the Barclay Bay Campground on Missinaibi Lake and end up at the town of Mattice, located north on Highway 11 (arrange to have your vehicle shuttled to that location). A classic pool and drop waterway, this section has some of the best whitewater paddling on this Canadian Heritage River. \n\n\u{2022} Peterbell to Mattice- intermediate to advanced, 7 to 10 days\n\tA few days shorter than the previous trip (Missinaibi Lake to Mattice), this adventure begins in the town of Foleyet (on Highway 101) where you board the VIA Rail passenger train and dropping you off at the rail-stop of Peterbell, on the Missinaibi River. \n\n\u{2022} Mattice to Moosonee- advanced, 10- 12 days\n\tStarting in the town of Mattice on Highway 11, this route takes you through some of the most spectacular scenery on the river, including Thunderhouse Falls, Stone Rapids and Hell’s Gate, as you transition from the rocky Precambrian shield to the James Bay Lowlands. This is a very remote section of the river, leaving roads far behind as you paddle north to James Bay. \n\n\u{2022} Shumka to Missanabie- novice to intermediate, 5-7 days, circle route\n\tStart in the town of Missanabie where you board the VIA Rail Budd Car that will take you and your gear to a rail-stop called Shumka, south of Bolkow Lake. There are several variations to this route, a lake-to-lake route, however the beauty of any of the options is that they take you right back to where your vehicle awaits you in Missanabie. This route travels through a remote part of the Chapleau Game Preserve. \n\nMissinaibi Lake to Little Missinaibi Lake back to Missinaibi Lake again-novice to intermediate, 7-8 days, circle route \n\nThis trip starts at the main campground on Missinaibi Lake where you have the opportunity to explore many of the lake’s highlights along the way.
