Perhaps the most thrilling aspect is the fall migration of hawks, vultures, and eagles. You can also witness Monarch Butterflies, Blue Jays and dragonflies on their spectacular migration. More than 85 species of migratory birds have been spotted here in the spring and our bird check list includes 232 species. Lake Erie presents a barrier to these seasonal movements so the flow of migrants concentrates at and moves along the shoreline in both the spring and fall. The park is an undiscovered birder’s paradise. It is located centrally between the renowned birding areas of Long Point, Rondeau and Point Pelee so the quantity and quality of birding is excellent."), 2: (heading: "\(aBtg)", detail: "Boat launching and docking facilities are located near the park with access to Lake Erie available through the Big Otter Creek.
